# Task-8: KMeasn Clustering
## Objective:
Perform unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering.
## Tools:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sci-Kit Learn
## Steps Followed:
1. Loaded and preprocessed the Customer Segmentation data
2. Reduced the dimensionality using PCA for easy visualization
3. Fitted 3-Measn and 4-Means cluster and assigned cluster labels.
4. Found the optimal 'K' value Using Elbow method and Silhouette Score.
5. Visualized the clusters using color coding.
